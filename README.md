### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how programming languages are created by building interpreters and basic compilers. Currently reading through "Crafting Interpreters" and following along, but instead of using Java, I decided to build the Interpreter using Rust because it has been the one language I've always wanted to learn.
